This repo holds individual human models, inspired by Psychology, and collective models inspired by Sociology. 

## The Human Model
Needs: Maslov's Set
Relationships:

Communications: 64 bits outbound, 64 bits inbound
Memory: 
Short term memory is 16 iterations of inbound comms (RAM). 
If the human is thinking, the inbound comes from its own memory
Short term becomes long term (disk) at an address chosen by the human
