## Glossary

Compromise model: a model that represents a compromise between, on the one hand, psychological models of human behavior, and on the other, the hard reality of computer architecture. The two systems can be translated as follows:


### Brain Model
### Memory Model - Atkinsonâ€“Shiffrin 
| Biological Concept           | CPU Equivalent | GPU Equivalent |
|------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Sensory memory               | Registers      | Thread Memory  |
| Short-term memory            | RAM            | VRAM           |
| Long-term memory             | SSD            | SSD/RAM        |
### Thought Model

### Communications Model - Homophily 
Measures absolute identity distance, and selects based on that

### Communications Model - Mills (The Sociological Imagination)
| Sociological Standing                     | CPU Equivalent | GPU Equivalent |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Micro-level: Family and Friends           | INTERTHREAD    | Warp (subgroup)|
| Meso-level: Small Companies               | INTERPROCESS   | Thread Block   |
| Macro-level: Large Companies, Governments | SSD            | Matrix Mailbox |


### Identity Model
| Name     | Random 64 bit identifier
| Sex      | Inverse bell curve 
| Mother   | Pointer to Mother
| Father   | Pointer to Father
| Money    | 64 bit int
| Children | Up to 16 Pointers, or NULL
| Genes    | 64x 64bit ints. Describe the layout of the neural net

### Needs Model - Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
1. **Physiological Needs**
   - Air,Water,Food,Shelter,Sleep,Clothing,Reproduction

2. **Safety Needs**
   - Personal security,Employment,Resources,Health,Property

3. **Love and Belonging**
   - Friendship,Intimacy,Family,Sense of connection

4. **Esteem**
   - Respect,Self-esteem,Status,Recognition,Strength,Freedom

5. **Self-actualization**
   - Desire to become the most that one can be


### Each Cycle, each human
1. Process Inbound communication
2. Run Brain Model
3. Run Outbound Communications Model

#### Input
1. Receives a message from another human
2. Gets assigned an outbound human
3. 

### Reproduction model - Sexual


### Chaos model
Pepper the memory with random bits. 
Increases as the system gets closer to capacity.




| Psychological Concept        | Parallel in Silicon Computing      |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Memory                       | RAM (Random Access Memory)          |
| Learning                     | Machine Learning Algorithms         |
| Decision Making              | Decision Trees                      |
| Perception                   | Sensors and Input Devices           |
| Attention                    | CPU Scheduling and Prioritization   |
